# F.E.E.L. (FrontEnd - Emulator Launcher)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Official web site: http://feelfrontend.altervista.org

Graphic frontend for retrogaming PCs (mame-cabinets, bartop, etc.) with animations, snap/videosnap management, customizable skins and configurable for infinite emulators and game lists and statistics controlled by arcade sticks, spinner, trackball, etc.

Provides support for horizontal and vertical screens (15/31khz, CRT/LCD) and LCD button dashboards through SmartASD card (http://www.arcadeitalia.net/viewtopic.php?t=20198).

## Technical info
Totally written in c# using
- Microsoft .NET framework 3.5 (VS 2008 EE+)
- Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.1
- SharpDx https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX
- SmartASD libs
- other smaller libs

This sw stack allows execution on almost *any* Windows PC, from oldest "usable" ones (say WinXP) to newest.
HW requirements are minimal (Intel P4 or similar, with even very old video cards, are adequate).

#### Building FEEL

Steps for building:

- install Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (it's usually on board on all recent Win OSes: please refer to specific doc)
- install Microsoft Visual C# Express 2008 (http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729278) or greater
- install Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.1 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39)
- start VC2008 and create a new empty project
- clone FEEL repository inside project's root directory
- add FEEL project using "Add.. Existing project" and selecting Feel.csproj
- build project either in Debug or Release mode
- copy all items in \__init_files__ (changelog, config, data, layouts...) into bin\x86\\[Debug|Release] directory 

Now you're ready to run the frontend.
